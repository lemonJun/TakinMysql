/**
 * Interface to the hooking mechanism of a connection lifecycle. Applications

 * default implementation. Applications might also want to make use of 
 * connection.setDebugHandle(...) to keep track of additional information on 
 * each connection.
 * 
 *  Since the class is eventually loaded via reflection, the implementation must 
 *  provide a public, no argument constructor.
 *  
 *  Warning: Be careful to make sure that the hook methods are re-entrant and
 *  thread-safe; do not rely on external state without appropriate locking, use appropriate 
 *  synchronization!

     *	<p>08007	Transaction resolution unknown.
     *	<p>08502	The CONNECT statement issued by an application process running with a SYNCPOINT of TWOPHASE has failed, because no transaction manager is available.
     *	<p>08504	An error was encountered while processing the specified path rename configuration file.
